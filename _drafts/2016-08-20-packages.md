This week I received parts of my recent Amazon orders:
* Monday: Abus Granit X-Plus 540 USH U-Lock
* Tuesday: Light & Motion Urban 350 bicycle headlight

And today, I've picked up two packages delivered on Thurs/Fri. One was for some Fluval Spec Biomax and the other was for the rest of the order:
* Fluval Spec Carbon
* Fluval Pre-filter
* Fluval Edge Gravel Cleaner
* Kryptonite 1214 New York Fagetaboutit chain
* Cygolight HotShot 50
* 16GB Ram for the Mac mini 

So, that covers bike security/lights and Fluval Spec spares, mods, tools. Luckily I think we can still make use of the Fluval Spec stuff in a Hang-on-the-back fiter. The mods were a wire mesh (delivered last week) to hang over the Spec's filter intake and a pre-filter sponge to diffuse the Spec's filter return output.
