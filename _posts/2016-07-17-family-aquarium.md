My daughter finally succumbed to family influences and peer presure and started to ask if she could have a pet of some kind. We're currently renting so my wife and I suggested she could have a fish. Somebody mentioned to my wife about a Betta, which kicked off the usual investigation.

There was a lot of opinion that suggested that these Betta's can live in tiny containers but I didn't want to get anything that small because I think that would be cruel. I was concerned if we had a 'proper' aquarium it would be difficult to move once our tennancy was up. I found a Fluval Spec III, which is an all-in-one tank with LED light and filter. It is only 2.5 gallons (US)/10 litres but that was still larger than all the Betta bowls They look great and would be easy to move but I knew that the smaller the tank the less stable the biological environment.
The Spec range has a very large filter to compensate for the potentially problematic size. It didn't seem like we could source one online as every Australian website listed them as out of stock. My wife popped into a local aquarium store and found we could order one. So, that's just what we did.

After a week the shop contacted us and said that they can't get hold of a Spec III so did we want to go for a Spec V and the same price. It's double the size at 5 gallons/19 litres but still pretty small so we accepted the offer. Another week passed and we had a phone call from the shop saying the Warehouse in Sydney didn't know how long it would be before they'd get some in the country because Fluval were updating the Spec range.
And after a few more confused calls telling us that the tanks were discontinued we went into the shop and got our money back.

It seemed that the only way we could get a Spec was to import one ourselves from the UK or US. The UK sites didn't seem to offer the latest LED upgraded tanks. The US sites were are confusing mix of old and new photos of the Spec models. I though more about the problems of having such a small tank for a relative beginner. I'd kept coldwater fish in an aquarium when I was younger but that seemed a long time ago and the tech had clearly changed.
The next day I walked into PetBarn a took a Fluval Curve 32 of the shelf. They're known as Fluval Vista in the US. This kit was also being upgraded in the US with a hang-on-the-back filter and other accessories. It seemed like this was a good as it was going to get in Australia, unless I wanted the ubiquitous Aqua One stuff.
I also picked up a box of Seiryu rocks, some API Stress Coat+ dechlorinater and an Aqua One 5-in-1 maintenance kit.

It was all too late for my daughters birthday and had become a Family aquarium.
