Today I collected a package containing an Aquael Easyheater 50, Dr Tim's One and Only, and Dr Tim's Ammonia. The heater is an unbreakable resin type that's capable of handling the drop in temperature of a house in Melbourne. It's also pretty compact so it won't look too intrusive in our 32 litre tank.
I looked into the live bacteria products on the market. The guy who originated these product was Dr Tim, who's company produces the most reliable product. I believe he holds patents on the specific bacteria combinations. Anyway, the One and Only will allow me to get the aquarium cycled hopefully within seven days. It will be a fishless cycle hence the Ammonia. I didn't want to chance it using some household ammonia so I've got a small bottle from him.
