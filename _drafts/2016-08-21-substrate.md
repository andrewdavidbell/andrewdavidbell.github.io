This afternoon I decided to visit a new aquarium store called Amazing Amazon in Glen Waverley, Vic. I've picked up a 4kg bag of Fluval Stratum and an API Master Freshwater Test Kit.

On the way back I popped into the Clayton branch of PetBarn to see if they had
some driftwood. They didn't have anything that I though would suit our tank
but I did get an aquarium background poster.
