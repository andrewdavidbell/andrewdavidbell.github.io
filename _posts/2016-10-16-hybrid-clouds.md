## Azure Discovery Day
Earlier this week I had the chance to go to an Azure Discovery Day with work. I couldn't help but try to compare the Azure features with the Amazon Web Service equivalent in order to understand what they were offering.

One of Microsoft's unique selling points is to offer a hybrid cloud to the enterprise. They had obviously worked hard to make the on-premise Azure Stack be compatible with the off-premise Azure Cloud.

## Amazon partnership
Then later in the week Amazon announced a partnership with VMware. VMware’s virtualization software will run on Amazon’s cloud, letting VMware customers manage virtual machines in Amazon’s cloud with the same set of tools they use to manage VMs on their own servers.

## Hybrid Clouds
So, whilst they might [not be the long term stratgy of many](http://www.cio.com/article/3107612/cloud-computing/why-private-clouds-will-suffer-a-long-slow-death.html), hybrid clouds do offer a path for organisations to migrate their solutions to the cloud on-prem before jumping into a public cloud. So, whether its on-prem or off-prem, everything should now be written with the cloud in mind.
